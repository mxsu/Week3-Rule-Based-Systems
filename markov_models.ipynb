        "Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.\n",
        "That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!\n",
        "Will we pick our job today?\n",
        "I heard it's just orientation.\n",
        "Heads up! Here we go.\n",
        "Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.\n",
        "Wonder what it'll be like?\n",
        "A little scary.\n",
        "Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.\n",
        "This is it!\n",
        "Wow.\n",
        "Wow.\n",
        "We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.\n",
        "Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.\n",
        "Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!\n",
        "That girl was hot.\n",

        "Not enough.\n",
        "Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.\n",
        "What does that do?\n",
        "Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.\n",
        "Saves us millions.\n",
        "Can anyone work on the Krelman?\n",
        "Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.\n",
        "But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.\n",
        "But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.\n",
        "The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.\n",
        "What's the difference?\n",
        "You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.\n",
        "So you'll just work us to death?\n",
        "We'll sure try.\n",
        "Wow! That blew my mind!\n",
        "\"What's the difference?\"\n",
        "How can you say that?\n",
        "One job forever?\n",
        "That's an insane choice to have to make.\n",
        "I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.\n",
        "But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?\n",
        "Why would you question anything? We're bees.\n",
        "We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.\n",
        "You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?\n",
        "Like what? Give me one example.\n",
        "I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.\n",
        "Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.\n",
        "Wait a second. Check it out.\n",
        "Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!\n",
        "Wow.\n",
        "I've never seen them this close.\n",
        "They know what it's like outside The Hive.\n",
        "Yeah, but some don't come back.\n",
        "Hey, Jocks!\n",
        "Hi, Jocks!\n",
        "You guys did great!\n",

        "Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.\n",
        "You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.\n",
        "Right.\n",
        "Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.\n",
        "It's just a status symbol.\n",
        "Bees make too much of it.\n",
        "Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.\n",
        "Those ladies?\n",
        "Aren't they our cousins too?\n",
        "Distant. Distant.\n",
        "Look at these two.\n",
        "Couple of Hive Harrys.\n",
        "Let's have fun with them.\n",
        "It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.\n",
        "Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!\n",
        "He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!\n",
        "Oh, my!\n",
        "I never thought I'd knock him out.\n",
        "What were you doing during this?\n",
        "Trying to alert the authorities.\n",
        "I can autograph that.\n",
        "A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?\n",
        "Yeah. Gusty.\n",
        "We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.\n",
        "Six miles, huh?\n",
        "Barry!\n",
        "A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.\n",
        "Maybe I am.\n",
        "You are not!\n",
        "We're going 0900 at J-Gate.\n",
        "What do you think, buzzy-boy?\n",
        "Are you bee enough?\n",
        "I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.\n",
        "Hey, Honex!\n",
        "Dad, you surprised me.\n",
        "You decide what you're interested in?\n",
        "Well, there's a lot of choices.\n",
        "But you only get one.\n",
        "Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?\n",
        "Son, let me tell you about stirring.\n",
        "You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.\n",
        "You get yourself into a rhythm.\n",
        "It's a beautiful thing.\n",
        "You know, Dad, the more I think about it,\n",
        "maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.\n",
        "You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?\n",
        "That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.\n",
        "Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!\n",
        "Barry, you are so funny sometimes.\n",
        "I'm not trying to be funny.\n",
        "You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!\n",
        "You're gonna be a stirrer?\n",
        "No one's listening to me!\n",
        "Wait till you see the sticks I have.\n",
        "I could say anything right now.\n",
        "I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\n",
        "Let's open some honey and celebrate!\n",
        "Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"!\n",
        "I'm so proud.\n",
        "We're starting work today!\n",
        "Today's the day.\n",

        "Wax monkey's always open.\n",
        "The Krelman opened up again.\n",
        "What happened?\n",
        "A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.\n",
        "Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.\n",

        "You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?\n",
        "Another call coming in.\n",
        "If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.\n",
        "Hey, guys.\n",
        "Look at that.\n",
        "Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?\n",

        "No, sir.\n",
        "I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.\n",
        "See that? It's a little bit of magic.\n",
        "That's amazing. Why do we do that?\n",
        "That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.\n",
        "Cool.\n",
        "I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?\n",

        "Call your first witness.\n",
        "So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.\n",
        "I suppose so.\n",
        "I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!\n",
        "Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.\n",
        "Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.\n",
        "I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?\n",
        "No.\n",
        "I couldn't hear you.\n",
        "No.\n",
        "No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.\n",
        "They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\n",
        "You mean like this?\n",
        "Bears kill bees!\n",
        "How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.\n",
        "So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?\n",
        "I was with a band called The Police.\n",
        "But you've never been a police officer, have you?\n",
        "No, I haven't.\n",
        "No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.\n",
        "Oh, please.\n",
        "Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\n",
        "That's not his real name?! You idiots!\n",
        "Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.\n",
        "Thank you. Thank you.\n",
        "I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.\n",
        "I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\n",
        "Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?\n",
        "Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!\n",
        "This isn't a goodfella.\n",
        "This is a badfella!\n",
        "Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!\n",
        "Order in this court!\n",
        "You're all thinking it!\n",
        "Order! Order, I say!\n",
        "Say it!\n",
        "Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\n",
        "I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.\n",
        "Are we doing everything right, legally?\n",
        "I'm a florist.\n",
        "Right. Well, here's to a great team.\n",
        "To a great team!\n",
        "Well, hello.\n",
        "Ken!\n",
        "Hello.\n",
        "I didn't think you were coming.\n",
        "No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.\n",
        "I didn't want all this to go to waste,\n",
        "so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\n",
        "Oh, that was lucky.\n",
        "There's a little left. I could heat it up.\n",
        "Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\n",
        "So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.\n",
        "That's where I usually sit. Right... there.\n",
        "Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.\n",
        "You think I don't see what you're doing?\n",
        "I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.\n",
        "Do we?\n",
        "Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.\n",
        "That's just what I was thinking about doing.\n",
        "Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\n",
        "I'm going to drain the old stinger.\n",
        "Yeah, you do that.\n",
        "Look at that.\n",
        "You know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games.\n",
        "What's that?\n",
        "Italian Vogue.\n",
        "Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\n",
        "A lot of ads.\n",
        "Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?\n",
        "Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here!\n",
        "I love the smell of flowers.\n",
        "How do you like the smell of flames?!\n",
        "Not as much.\n",
        "Water bug! Not taking sides!\n",
        "Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!\n",
        "This is pathetic!\n",
        "I've got issues!\n",
        "Well, well, well, a royal flush!\n",
        "You're bluffing.\n",
        "Am I?\n",
        "Surf's up, dude!\n",
        "Poo water!\n",
        "That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings!\n",
        "Kenneth! What are you doing?!\n",
        "You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!\n",
        "We need to talk! He's just a little bee!\n",
        "And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!\n",
        "Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?\n",
        " No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!\n",
        "Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\n",
        "My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!\n",
        "Goodbye, Ken.\n",
        "And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!\n",
        "I'm sorry about all that.\n",
        "I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!\n",
        "I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it.\n",
        "Oh, well.\n",
        "Are you OK for the trial?\n",
        "I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.\n",
        "We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\n",
        "Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.\n",
        "Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.\n",
        "You got the tweezers?\n",
        "Are you allergic?\n",
        "Only to losing, son. Only to losing.\n",
        "Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.\n",
        "What exactly is your relationship to that woman?\n",
        "We're friends.\n",
        "Good friends?\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "How good? Do you live together?\n",
        "Wait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug?\n",
        "I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?\n",
        "Yeah, but...\n",
        "So those aren't your real parents!\n",
        "Oh, Barry...\n",
        "Yes, they are!\n",

        "Order! Order!\n",
        "The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!\n",

        "Yeah.\n",
        "I... I blew the whole case, didn't I?\n",
        "It doesn't matter. What matters is\n",
        "you're alive. You could have died.\n",
        "I'd be better off dead. Look at me.\n",
        "They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it.\n",
        "What was it like to sting someone?\n",
        "I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!\n",
        "All right.\n",
        "You think it was all a trap?\n",
        "Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.\n",

        "I actually heard a funny story about...\n",
        "Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?\n",

        "What do you mean?\n",
        "We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.\n",
        "Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?\n",
        "First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.\n",
        "Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.\n",
